##### Delegation Event Model ######
=============================
- The delegation event model defines the standard background mechanism to process on generated event.
- In this model, Source generates events and send that event to the event listener.
***Event:
- Event is an action performed on any source.
- Event is a result's of user action which changes the state of source.
- Source will generates the event.
- Example:
	clicking on push button, pressing key from keyboard, clicking mouse button, selecting item from list, check or uncheck checkbox.etc

***Source:
- Source is a component object on which action is performed. 
- Source can generates more than one type of events.
- It is necessary that source must register listener.
- Each event has its own registration method.
-Example:
		Sources :- Button, Choice, List, Checkbox, Menuitem,TextArea,TextField,etc
- We can use following method to register listener on source.
	void addActionListener(), void addItemListener(), void addKeyListener(), void addWindowListener()
- We can remove the registration of listener.
- Example:
			removeActionListener(), removeItemListener(),removeWindowListener(), etc
			
***Listener:
- Listener is an object which gets notified when event occurs.
- Listener listen the event which is generated by source and take action accordingly(called particular method).
- Example:
			MouseListener, ActionListener, WindowListener, ItemListener, etc
- We require to import java.awt.event package for event handling.
