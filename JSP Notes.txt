JSP:
==========
- JSP stands for Java Server Page.
- JSP is similar to ASP(Active Server Page).
- JSP used at server side.
- JSP do not <SERVLET> tag in an html file.
- Every block of code is called as scriplet.
- The scriplet is begin with <% and ends with %>
- JSP has got four predefined variables.
1) request: This is servlet request and is object of HttpServletRequest class.
2) response: This is servlet respone and is object of HttpServletResponse class.
3) out: It is an output writer and is an object of PrintWriter.
4) in: It is input reader and is an object of BufferedReader class.
- Extension of JSP file is .jsp. Eg hello.jsp
- If we want run above jsp file then we can use URL http://server:port/hello.jsp.
Example of hello.jsp file
================
<html>
<body>
<%
			if(request.getParameter("name")==null)
			{
					out.println("No user entered");
			}
			else
			{
					out.println("Hello "+request.getParameter("name"));
			}
%>
</body>
</html>
======================
Expression and Directives:
======================
- As we know that JSP use scriplets. JSP also use expressions and directive.
- A JSP expression begin with <%= and ends with %>.
- A JSP directive begin with <%@ and ends with %>. We use directive like <%@ varname="value" %>
There are total six variables that can be used.
1) content_type:
E.g - <%@ content_type="text/plain" %>

2) import:
E.g - <%@ import="java.io.*,java.util.*,java.lang.*"%>

3) extends:
E.g - <%@ extends="SuperClass1" %>

4) implements:
E.g - <%@ implements="interface name" %>

5) method:
E.g - <%@ method="doGet" %>

6) language:
E.g - <%@ language="java" %>
==================================
Life Cycle of JSP Page:
==================
Following steps are involved in JSP Life Cycle:

1) Compilation
2) Initialization
3) Execution
4) Cleanup

JSP Compilation:
-----------------------
- Here, we can compile the jsp page.
- In compilation process, following phases are present
I) Parsing the JSP
II) Converting JSP into Servlet
3) Compilation of the servlet.

JSP Initialization:
------------------------
- It is used to initialize database connection, create lookup tables and open files, etc.

JSP Execution:
---------------------
- In this phase, JSP engine trying to process request  and will try to generate response.
public void _jspService(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res)
{
		//body
}

JSP Cleanup:
-------------------
-In this phase, JSP got removed from the container. it means, whatever the resources allocated for the JSP got removed.
