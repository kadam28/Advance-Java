#### Servlets ####
================
- Web browser & servers.
- Servlets are web pages generated by the web servers in response to the request send by the clients.
- MIME type (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension). Eg. text/pain, text/html, etc
- CGI (Common Gateway Interface). C,C++,perl
-> Performance of servlets is better than CGI
-> CGI is not platform independent but servlets is platform independent.
-> Sun, Netscape and Microsoft web servers offer servlet API.
-> The programs developed for this API can be moved to any of these environment without recompiling them.
-> Java security manager will helps us to set restriction to access resources of server machine.
-> As we know java has great collection of java class libraries and all these are available for servlet.

Types of Servlets:

1) Generic Servlets												2) HTTP Servlets

- Used javax.servlet package.									- Use javax.servlet.http package.
- Protocol independent											- Protocol dependent.
- It will execute service() method								- It will execute doGet() and doPost().

##Servlet Life Cycle:
=================
init()
service()
destroy()


Step-1:
- User enter URL in web browser and generates HTTP request for this URL. 
- This request transfer to appropriate web server.

Step-2:
- HTTP request received by web server. Server map this request to the particular servlet then servlet loaded into address space of web server.

Step-3: 
- Server invokes the init() method of servlet. When servlet first loaded into the computer memory then this method will get called.
- The initialization parameter passed to the servlet so that it will configure itself.

public void init(ServletConfig config)
{

}

Step-4:
- Server invoke service() method. This method is used to process HTTP request.
- service() method accept the request parameter and process it and try to create HTTP response for the client.
- servlet available in server address space and it is able to process each HTTP request.

public void service(ServletRequest req,ServletResponse res)
{

}

Step-5:
- Server may take decision to unload the servlet from its memory. Server will use algorithm to take this decision.
- The server will invoke destroy() method to released the resources which are allocated for the servlet.

public void destroy()
{

}
